# LSTM-ANN-SVM-For-Stock-Price-Prediction



## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Total Energies using three different machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to compare the performance of these models and identify which one provides the most accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- data: Contains the dataset used for the prediction.
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies needed to run the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the historical stock price data of Total Energies. It includes features such as:

- Date
- Opening Price
- Closing Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Volume

## Models Used

### 1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective in learning from sequential data. In this project, LSTM is used to capture the temporal dependencies in stock prices.

### 2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
ANN is a fundamental machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. It is used to find patterns and make predictions based on historical stock data.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, SVM is applied to predict stock prices based on the dataset.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/total-energies-stock-prediction.git
